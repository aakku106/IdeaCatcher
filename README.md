# IdeaCatcher

**IdeaCatcher** is a cutting-edge note-taking and idea-organizing platform built with **Blazor WebAssembly**. Designed to respect user privacy, it stores all data locally in **IndexedDB** while providing a sleek and interactive PWA experience. Perfect for creative thinkers, students, and professionals, IdeaCatcher allows you to manage your ideas effortlessly, even offline.
