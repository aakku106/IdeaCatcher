    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 30, 2024</p>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>By using the IdeaCatcher app (the "App"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms and
            Conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, you must refrain from using the App. These terms apply to
            all users of the App, regardless of the platform or device used.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Ownership:</strong> All data entered and stored in the App is owned by you, the user.
            IdeaCatcher does not collect or store any personal data, usage data, or any other data that identifies you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored locally on your device, specifically within the browser's
            IndexedDB. This means that only you have access to your data, and it is not shared with anyone else unless
            you explicitly share it. If you use the App on different browsers or devices, the data is not synchronized
            unless you manually export or import it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No Data Collection:</strong> The developer does not collect any user data, and the App does not use
            any analytics tools to track your usage. Not a single byte of data is collected or transmitted by the
            developer of the App.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. User Definition</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Who is a User:</strong> A user is anyone who has access to the device (laptop, PC, iOS, Mac,
            Android, Linux, or any other device) on which the IdeaCatcher App is installed. The App does not ask for a
            password or any form of authentication. However, users can set passwords for specific folders within the App
            to restrict access.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>The App is designed to prioritize data security by keeping your data stored locally on your device. It is
            important to protect your device with appropriate security measures (e.g., passwords, encryption) to ensure
            that unauthorized users do not access your data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Usage Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You may use the IdeaCatcher App only for lawful purposes. You may not use the App in any way that violates
            applicable laws or regulations. The developer of IdeaCatcher is not responsible for any data loss or issues
            caused by misuse of the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The content, design, and source code of the IdeaCatcher App are the property of the developer and are
            protected by intellectual property laws. By using the App, you are granted a license to use it as per the
            terms outlined in this document.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Open Source and License</h2>
        <p>The IdeaCatcher app is an open-source project. It is released under the MIT License, which allows you to
            freely use, modify, and distribute the code within the terms of the license. The developer is committed to
            using open-source tools to build and maintain the App wherever possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Modifications to the Terms</h2>
        <p>The developer reserves the right to modify or update these Terms and Conditions at any time. You will be
            notified of any significant changes, and continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance
            of the new terms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The developer is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting
            from the use or inability to use the IdeaCatcher App. This includes, but is not limited to, data loss,
            system failures, or any security breaches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in
            which the developer operates. Any disputes arising from the use of the IdeaCatcher App will be subject to
            the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.</p>
